## KaryTree

``` 
KaryTree(v)
```

> create a binary tree graph with `v` vertices.

``` 
KaryTree(v, m)
```

> create a `m`-ary tree graph with `v` vertices. In graph theory, an m-ary tree (for nonnegative integers `m`) (also known as n-ary, k-ary, k-way or generic tree) is a graph in which each node has no more than m children. A binary tree is an important case where `m = 2`; similarly, a ternary tree is one where `m = 3`.

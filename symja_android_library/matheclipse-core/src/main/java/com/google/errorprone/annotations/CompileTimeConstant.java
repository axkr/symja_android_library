/**
 * Annotation for method parameter declarations, which denotes that corresponding actual parameters
 * must be compile-time constant expressions.
 *
 * <p>When the formal parameter of a method or constructor is annotated with the {@link
 * CompileTimeConstant} type annotation, the corresponding actual parameter must be an expression
 * that satisfies one of the following conditions:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The expression is one for which the Java compiler can determine a constant value at compile
 *       time, or
 *   <li>the expression consists of the literal {@code null}, or
 *   <li>the expression consists of a single identifier, where the identifier is a formal method
 *       parameter that is declared {@code final} and has the {@link CompileTimeConstant}
 *       annotation.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This constraint on call sites of methods or constructors that have one or more formal
 * parameters with this annotation is enforced by <a href="http://errorprone.info">error-prone</a>.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following code snippet is legal:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class C {
 *   private static final S = "Hello";
 *   void m(@CompileTimeConstant final String s) { }
 *   void n(@CompileTimeConstant final String t) {
 *     m(S + " World!");
 *     m(null);
 *     m(t);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In contrast, the following is illegal:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class C {
 *   void m(@CompileTimeConstant final String s) { }
 *   void n(String t) {
 *     m(t);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Compile-time constant values are implicitly under the control of the trust domain of the
 * application whose source code they are part of. Hence, this annotation is useful to constrain the
 * use of APIs that may only be safely called with values that are under application control.
 *
 * <p>The current implementation of the @CompileTimeConstant checker cannot reason about more
 * complex scenarios, for example, returning compile-time-constant values from a method, or storing
 * compile-time-constant values in a collection. APIs will typically accommodate such use cases via
 * domain-specific types that capture domain-specific aspects of trustworthiness that arise from
 * values being under application control.

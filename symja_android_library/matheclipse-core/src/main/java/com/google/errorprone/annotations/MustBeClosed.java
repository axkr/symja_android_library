/**
 * Annotation for constructors of AutoCloseables or methods that return an AutoCloseable and require
 * that the resource is closed.
 *
 * <p>This is enforced by checking that invocations occur within the resource variable initializer
 * of a try-with-resources statement, which guarantees that the resource is always closed. The
 * analysis may be improved in the future to recognize other patterns where the resource will always
 * be closed.
 *
 * <p>Note that Android SDK versions prior to 19 do not support try-with-resources, so the
 * annotation should be avoided on APIs that may be used on Android.

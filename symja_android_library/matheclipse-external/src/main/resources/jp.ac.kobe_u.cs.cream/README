Cream: Class Library for Constraint Programming in Java

http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/cream/

		Please try Java with Cream.
		Although I personally prefer black coffee in real life...
		JAVA+CREAM=SOLVER

================
Features

Cream is a class library helping Java programmers to develop
intelligent programs requiring constraint satisfaction or optimization
on finite domains.  The followings are features of Cream.

* 100% Pure Java:
  Whole programs are written in Java.

* Open source:
  Cream is distributed as a free software with source code.
  Please refer to the LICENSE file for more details about licensing
  issue.

* Natural description of constraints:
  Various constraints can be naturally described within Java syntax.

* Easy enhancements:
  Programmers can easily enhance/extend constraint descriptions and
  satisfaction algorithms.

* Various optimization algorithms:
  Various optimization algorithms are available, such as Simulated
  Annealing, Taboo Search, etc.

================
Requirements

* Java J2SE 6

================
Installation

There is nothing special for installation.  Please unzip the
downloaded zip file from the web page, then you are ready to run
example programs as follows.

* on Unix-like systems:

	cd build
	java -classpath cream105.jar:examples.jar examples.FourColor

* on Windows systems:

	cd build
	java -classpath cream105.jar;examples.jar examples.FourColor

Acknowledgement

Cream was developed as a part of HECS (HEterogeneous Constraint
Solver) system which was supported in part by METI and IPA (The
Information-technology Promotion Agency) under grant of 2002
Exploratory Software Project and 2003 Exploratory Software Project.
Some improvement ideas of Cream are obtained through the discussion
with Mr. Kino, a project manager of IPA Exploratory Software Project
and also a developer of K-Prolog and ICS in Java.  I would like to
give special thanks to Shuji Ohnishi and other contributers listed
below.

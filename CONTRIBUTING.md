1. [Questions & Concerns](#questions-concerns)
2. [Issues & Bugs](#issues-bugs)
3. [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
4. [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests) 

### Questions & Concerns

If you have any questions about using or developing for this project, send a question in the [Discord Symja chat][5] or directly via [email][1].

### Issues & Bugs

Submit an [issue][2] or [pull request][3] with a fix if you find any bugs in
the project. See [below](#submitting-pull-requests) for instructions on sending
in pull requests.

When submitting an issue or pull request, make sure you're as detailed as possible
and fill in all answers to questions asked in the templates. For example, an issue
that simply states "X/Y/Z isn't working!" will be ignored.

### Feature Requests

Submit an [issue][2] to request a new feature. Features fall into one of two
categories:

1. **Major**: Major changes should be discussed in the [Discord chat group][5]. We're
always open to suggestions and will get back to you as soon as we can!
2. **Minor**: A minor feature can simply be added via a [pull request][3].

### Submitting Pull Requests

<h1>Real and Complex Root Computation package.</h1>

<p>
    This package contains classes for the computation of
    isolating and refining intervals of real roots and complex roots of univariate polynomials.
</p>
<p>
    Method <code>algebraicRoots()</code> from class <code>RootFactory</code>
    computes both the real and complex algebraic roots of a univariate polynomial.
    Method <code>decimalRoots()</code> computes isolating intervals (or rectangles) for the roots
    and then uses a numerical algorithm to get a decimal approximation of the roots.
</p>
<p>
    For the computation of real roots the main interface is <code>RealRoots</code>
    and main implementing class is <code>RealRootsSturm</code>.
    The implementation follows in part
    section 8.8 "Computation of real zeroes of Polynomial Systems"
    in <em>Gr&ouml;bner Bases</em>, A computational Approach to Commutative Algebra, by Becker et
    al.
    <br/>
    The class <code>RealAlgebraicNumber</code> is based on <code>AlgebraicNumber</code>
    with factory class <code>RealAlgebraicRing</code> based on <code>AlgebraicNumberRing</code>.
    They implement real algebraic numbers, which are algebraic numbers plus an
    isolating interval for a real root of the generator.
    <code>RealRootsSturm</code> can be applied to polynomials with real algebraic
    numbers as coefficients.
</p>
<p>
    For the computation of complex roots the main interface is <code>ComplexRoots</code>
    and the main implementing class is <code>ComplexRootsSturm</code>.
    The implementation provides an exact infallible method which follows the numeric method of Wilf
    (see Wilf: A global bisection algorithm for computing the zeros of polynomials in the complex
    plane).
    It uses Sturm sequences following the Routh-Hurwitz Method
    to count the number of complex roots within a rectangle in the complex plane.
    For a (eventually) more efficient method see:
    Collins and Krandick: An efficient algorithm for infallible polynomial complex root isolation,
    in ISSAC'92.

/**
 * The algorithm determines the k shortest simple paths in increasing order of weight. Weights can
 * be negative (but no negative cycle is allowed), and paths can be constrained by a maximum number
 * of edges. Graphs with multiple (parallel) edges are allowed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is a variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm but instead of only storing the best
 * path it stores the "k" best paths at each pass, yielding a complexity of $O(k \cdot n \cdot
 * (m^2))$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of vertices.
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
 * @deprecated Use {@link YenKShortestPath} instead.

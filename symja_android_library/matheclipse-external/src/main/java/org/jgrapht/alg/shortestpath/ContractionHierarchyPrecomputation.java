/**
 * Parallel implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies">
 * contraction hierarchy route planning precomputation technique</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The original algorithm is described the article: Robert Geisberger, Peter Sanders, Dominik
 * Schultes, and Daniel Delling. 2008. Contraction hierarchies: faster and simpler hierarchical
 * routing in road networks. In Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental
 * algorithms (WEA'08), Catherine C. McGeoch (Ed.). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 319-333.
 *
 * <p>
 * Parallel version of the algorithm is described in the article: Vetter, Christian. "Parallel
 * Time-Dependent Contraction Hierarchies." (2009).
 *
 * <p>
 * This algorithm speeds up shortest paths computation by contracting graph vertices. To contract a
 * vertex means to remove it from the graph in such a way that shortest paths in the remaining
 * overlay graph are preserved. This property is achieved by replacing paths of the form $\langle u,
 * v, w\rangle$ by a shortcut edge $(u, w)$. Note that the shortcut $(u, w)$ is only required if
 * $\langle u, v, w\rangle$ is the only shortest path from $u$ to $w$.
 *
 * <p>
 * Contraction is performed as follows. First a priority is computed for each vertex in the graph.
 * This implementation uses edge quotient, complexity quotient and hierarchical depth metrics for
 * computing priority. A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively contracting independent sets of
 * vertices. A vertex is independent iff it`s priority is less than the priority of every vertex in
 * its 2-neighbourhood. A 2-neighbourhood of a vertex $v$ is defined as a set of vertices that are
 * reachable from $v$ using at most 2 hops. After contraction each vertex gets its unique
 * contraction level - its position in the computed hierarchy. Finally, after all vertices are
 * contracted each edge is set to be either upward if its source has lower level that its target, or
 * downward if vice versa.
 *
 * <p>
 * Computing initial priorities, independent sets and shortcuts, updating neighbours priorities and
 * marking upward edges is performed in parallel what gives this implementation performance speedup
 * comparing to the sequential approach.
 *
 * <p>
 * For parallelization, this implementation relies on the {@link ExecutorService}.

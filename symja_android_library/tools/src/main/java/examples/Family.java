/**
 * Example obtained from "Finite Domain Constraint Programming in Oz"
 *
 * <p>
 * Maria and Clara are both heads of households, and both families have three boys and three girls.
 * Neither family includes any children closer in age than one year, and all children are under age
 * 10. The youngest child in Maria's family is a girl, and Clara has just given birth to a little
 * girl.
 *
 * <p>
 * In each family, the sum of the ages of the boys equals the sum of the ages of the girls, and the
 * sum of the squares of the ages of the boys equals the sum of the the squares of ages of the
 * girls. The sum of the ages of all children is 60.
 *
 * <p>
 * What are the ages of the children in each family?

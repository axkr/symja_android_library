/**
 * The method to which this annotation is applied acquires one or more locks. The caller will hold
 * the locks when the function finishes execution.
 *
 * <p>This annotation does not apply to built-in (synchronization) locks, which cannot be acquired
 * without being released in the same method.
 *
 * <p>The arguments determine which locks the annotated method acquires:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>field-name</code>: The lock is referenced by the final instance field specified by
 *       <em>field-name</em>.
 *   <li><code>class-name.this.field-name</code>: For inner classes, it may be necessary to
 *       disambiguate 'this'; the <em>class-name.this</em> designation allows you to specify which
 *       'this' reference is intended.
 *   <li><code>class-name.field-name</code>: The lock is referenced by the static final field
 *       specified by <em>class-name.field-name</em>.
 *   <li><code>method-name()</code>: The lock object is returned by calling the named nullary
 *       method.
 * </ul>

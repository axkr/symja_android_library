## TTest

```
TTest(real-vector)
```

> Returns the *observed significance level*, or *p-value*, associated with a one-sample, two-tailed t-test comparing the mean of the input vector with the constant <code>0.0</code>.

```
TTest({real-vector1, real-vector2})
```

> Returns the *observed significance level*, or *p-value*, associated with a two-sample, two-tailed t-test comparing the means of the input vectors, under the assumption that the two samples are drawn from subpopulations with equal variances.

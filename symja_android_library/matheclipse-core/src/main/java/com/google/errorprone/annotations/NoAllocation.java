/**
 * Annotation for method declarations, which denotes that this method will not cause allocations

 * <p>Be careful using this annotation. It should be used sparingly, typically only for methods
 * called within inner loops or user interface event handlers. Misuse will likely lead to decreased
 * performance and significantly more complex code.
